    <p>RNames is a relational database linking stratigraphic names with each other that are considered to be time-equivalent or time-overlapping.</p>
    <p>Each link in the database is drawn from a published reference and is considered as an expressed opinion. The sum of published opinions can be used to correlate a certain name with another name and ultimately to bin within a certain time frame. This is what this database is for. (<a href="{% url 'rnames-detail'%}" target="_blank">more</a>)</p>
    <p>Currently RNames contains {{ num_names }} Stratigraphic names, {{ num_opinions }} Opinions, and {{ num_references }} References.</p>

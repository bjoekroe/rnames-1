<h1>More about RNames</h1>
<article>
  Combined with an r-code (which will be published separately) the database is a tool to construct a list of names that
  are considered to be time equivalent in a certain framework. The algorithm of the correlation is based on explicit
  rules (e.g., "use the most actual opinion" or "use the best compromise between existing opinions").

  The resulting list of correlated names was primarily built to be matched with the stratigraphical names that define
  fossil occurrences in the PaleoDB. Currently three lists are available (Stage Slices, Time Slices, and Stages). But
  there is no limit to construct additional lists.

  The database currently contains only names that are related to the Ordovician Period, but there is no limitation to
  other time periods.

  The database is meant to grow, and the complete lists will become open access in the near future. You are invited to
  contribute and to add additional datasets, improve the code, etc.

  RNames participated in University of Helsinki’s <a href="https://github.com/HY-TKTL/TKT20007-Ohjelmistotuotantoprojekti">Software Development Project</a> course in the fall of 2021. During the
  course a team consisting of computer science students aided in the development of RNames. The team consisted of the
  following members: Ekaterina Khlebova, Tuomas Koukkari, Toni Mobin, Tatu Nousiainen, Anita Penttilä, Jenna Rantanen
  and Salla-Mari Uitto.
